    "A solution to having many outliers is the RANSAC method which is the standard method of fitting models in presence of having outliers. Since we have a normal fitting problem this solution can be applied whenever the goal is to estimate the parameters of a model. Therefore this is not exclusive to motion estimation and can allso be applied for example to SFM, Calibration or PnP and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept of RANSAC is that it samples randomly points and the tries to fit a model that describe these points. Then for all remaining points the error is calculated and the number of points inside e current region around our model/line are counted. Then the process is repeated. In the end we hselect the model with most points inside a certain region as the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is a example in more detail. Let go through the images from left to right. Given a set of points we select two points randomly. Then We fit a model throught these points. In this example we just draw a line. Then we calculate the error of all other points to that model. In our case this is just the shortest distance from our model/line to the point. Then we select all the data that support the hypothsis of our current model. This means we select the points that are inside a certain threshold around the model.\n",

    "After k iterations we select the modle that hast most datapoint inside its support region. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we make sure that the produced results are reliable. As seen in the example when we only iterate 3 times and each time only select 2 points for fitting the model we will no reach a meaning full result. In the example above only at the forth iteration we reach a reasonable model. So what what is the optimal amount of point to use for fitting and what it the optmal number of iterations? \n",
    "So idelly we would always select 2 points for fitting and check all possible combinations of them. This however is computationallya very expensive since then there are $N(N-1)/2$ combinations possible for $N$ points. Even with only 1000 points this leadt to 500'000 combinations. So we would like to reduce the cost by not checking all possibilites and stop the RANSAC before. We can find out the optimal number of iterations in a probabilistic way."

Usually the user can choose these two parameters and therefor can decide the probaility of success and the inlier ratio. For example if we set the probaility of success ($p$) to 99% and the inlier ration $w$ to 50% we get $k=16$ iterations. This are significanlty fewer iterations than all combinations. Also notices that this derivation does not directly depend on the total number of points. Only $w$ depends on the total number of points.\n",
