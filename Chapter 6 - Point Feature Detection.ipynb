    "To illustrate this concept, let's have a look at an image with some simple structures on it. We can copy a small region of our image and use it as a filter / template. When we slide this filter over the image, we'll get a so called *correlation map* that indicates how well the template matched the original picture at each possible position. As we might expect, the point of best correlation is found at the brightest pixel at exactly the position where we extracted the template originally. \n",
