    "In this chapter we will dive into the field of place recognition. In the context of visual odometry place recognition is importent for recognizin when arriving at a already visited location so that loops can be closed. In order to be able to efficiently recognize locations we need a efficient representation of the features of a imgae whicih then can be clustered and seaeched for similar ones. Obviously place recognition can also be used for other application for example image retrieval where we want to find similar images to a given one.\n"
