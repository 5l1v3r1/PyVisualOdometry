Sometimes we also want to construct a scene from a set of images of the same scene from different alges, cameras and even from different days. In this case we can not rely on the sequetial order and therefore we do not know the spacial and temporal relation between different images.

We match two images together if they have matching images/frames, we call them nearby frames. The we spilt the image set into clusters of 3 nearby/matching frames. Now we can use two of the images to apply SFM. As a result we get the translation and rotation between the cameras. From this informtaion we can now triangluate the points int he 3D space and create a point cloud. We can then merge the third point into the pointcloud by using the 3-point RANSAC between pointcloud and third image. we get again the rotation and translation of the third view in respect to a reference view of the pointcloud. Refer the the section about 3D-to-2D later on in this chapter. Like this we then can add new features of the third view to the point cloud. We can now merge clusters pairwisse using matching features in both clusters.this we can do as before using the roation and translation between both reference views. This can be done using RANSAC again. In the end we can use Bundle Adjustment to refine the tructure as well as camera locations.\n",

    "To start of we have to initialize the algorithm with a pointcloud. So we start of with a 2D-to-2D case. For the initialisation we need two frames that overlap in feature points however thes also should not overlap to much as otherwise the point clound would not be big enought. As seen before we can use 5 or 8 point algorithhm for this initialisation. after that we can use bundle adjustment to refine the pointcloud and the pose of the two frames. The to frames we use for initalisation we call are also keyframes. The whole initialsation process is called **bootstrapping**.\n",

If they are to close together, so when the baseline is too small, then there is a large depth uncertainty. If they are far apart then the depth is mor certain. However too far apart the images should also not be because otherwise there are not anought overlapping features anymore. As a result we skip some of the frame to have frames that are not to cloe to each others. We skipp untill the uncertainty falls below a threshold. The resulting selected frames are called **keyframes**. As a rule of thumb we add a ekyframe if the ratio of keframe distance devided by the average depth is larger than 10-20%.\n",

We can speed up bundle adjustment by applying it to a sliding window since like this the number of points and pose parameters is reduced. Also we can reduce the complexity by just optimizing over the camera parameters and keeping the 3D points fixed.\n",

    "Another way of optimizing the pose estimations is the **loop-closure-detection**. This a also known as place recognizion since we try to reidentify locations where we were previously.

Therefor we can spilt the loop closing into two parts. First the detection of previousl mapped area. And the loop correction which adjusts the trajectory. Also in such a case where we encounter previously mapped areas it is important not to produce a map duplication otherwise we have a pointcloud with multiple times the same 3D features at different locations. This ould lead to a problem when detecting the same features a third time. then we would not know where to close the loop.\n",
